# vba-tasks
This VBA code opens Outlook with a pre-formatted email when an Excel cell is filled with "In Progress", for the purpose of alerting the Call Center to open tickets.

The VBA code is designed to automate the process of sending a notification to the Call Center when a task has been marked as "In Progress". By using the built-in functionality of Excel, the code is able to detect when a specific cell has been filled with the text "In Progress". Once this is detected, the code will automatically open Microsoft Outlook and create a new email with a pre-formatted message. This message can be customized to include any relevant information, such as the task name, task number, or the name of the person responsible for the task. The email is then sent to the Call Center, alerting them to open a new ticket for the task that is now in progress. This automation not only saves time for the person responsible for the task, but also ensures that the Call Center is immediately aware of any new tasks that need their attention.
